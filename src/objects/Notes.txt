The object keyword in Kotlin lets you define a type that only has a single instance — a named object.

A type defined with object cannot have constructors: Since there is only one instance of an object, there is no reason
to provide constructor functions to create other instances. In a sense, the type is the instance.

Another example use case is to use object to provide a namespace for constants and methods that need to be referenced
from multiple places in your app. . By putting constants into an object, you reduce the likelihood of name collisions
when your constants are given commonly used names

While constructors are not allowed for objects, they do have many similarities with classes:
• Objects can have properties and member functions.
• Properties of the object must be initialized before use, either at declaration or in an init block.
• Objects can inherit from classes and implement interfaces.

You implement static members in kotlin by using companion object
